## &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winter Wheat Growth Cycle

The growth cycle of winter wheat is defined by distinct phases, each of which is influenced by various factors, including soil nutrient composition, weather conditions, and fertilizer application. Observing and analyzing the growth of a wheat plantation under different conditions, from optimal to difficult, offers a fascinating opportunity to understand the key factors influencing this process.

In order to fully grasp the model and the results it generates, it is essential to possess a solid comprehension of the life cycle of winter wheat and the various factors that influence it.

## &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stages of Winter Wheat Growth Cycle

The winter wheat growth cycle lasts between 9 and 10 months and here's a general timeline of the growth stages:

1. *Germination*: After planting, the seed will absorb soil's nutrients and begin to swell. The seed coat will then crack open, and a small root will emerge from one end, followed by a small plant that rises above the soil.

2. *Tillering*: The wheat plant will continue to grow leaves and stems, forming a root system that reaches deeper into the soil. The plant will start to produce tillers, which are side shoots that grow from the main stem. At the end of this stage, the seeds that have not germinated will rot. This stage can last for several weeks to a few months, depending on the growing conditions.

3. *Stem Extension*: The wheat plant will continue to grow taller, with the stem elongating at a rapid pace. While more tillers and leaves are produced. This stage can last for several weeks to a few months.

4. *Booting and Heading stage*: The wheat plant begins to form spikes, at the top of the Tillers. The spike will be enclosed in a protective sheath, called a boot, by the end of this phase spike will emerge from the protective sheath. These phases can last for several weeks to a few months.

5. *Flowering and Grain Fill*: The wheat plant will enter its reproductive stage, with Flowers appearing on the spikes. Pollination will occur, and the flowers will develop into kernels of wheat. These kernels will fill with starch and protein, resulting in a mature grain. These phases last few months.

6. *Ripening and Harvesting*: The wheat Kernels continue to ripen until they reach maturity. The wheat crop is ready for harvest when the grain is fully mature and the plant has turned golden brown in color. These phases can last from several weeks to months.


## &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Influencing Factors
During the early stages of growth, wheat seeds need adequate soil nutrients to germinate. Under favorable conditions, the plant start emerge within ten days.

Until the first ear emerges, the seedling depends on the energy and nutrients stored in the seed. The plant start developing tillers basing on environmental conditions such as daily water received and temperature. Wheat seeds enjoy an optimal temperature between 10°C and 20°C and 4mm-6mm of water per day.

As the growth cycle progresses, the Tillers begin to produce Flowers, but it is important to know that not all Tillers will flower, in fact at best only half of the Tillers will produce a flower. Once the flowers appear the quantity of fertilizer applied to them and the soil's nutrients will determine how many Kernels there will be per flower, at best a flower produces from 20 to 50 kernels.
