# Winter Wheat Growth Cycle

The winter wheat growth cycle is characterized by several phases, each of which is influenced
by certain factors such as the nutrient content of a specific seed, weather conditions or
the characteristics of the soil in which it is sown. It is interesting to observe and analyze
how a wheat plantation grows under different conditions, from the best to the worst, and
which factors influence it the most.

## Stages of Wheat Growth Cycle
The winter wheat growth cycle lasts between 270 to 330 days, depending on environmental conditions and seeds characteristics.
Here's a general timeline of the growth stages:

1. Germination (Day 0-10): After planting, the seed will absorb water and begin to swell. The seed coat will then crack open, and a small root will emerge from one end, followed by a shoot that rises above the soil.

2. Tillering (Day 10-70): The wheat plant will continue to grow leaves and stems, forming a root system that reaches deeper into the soil. The plant will start to produce tillers, which are side shoots that grow from the main stem. At the end of this stage, the seeds that have not germinated will rot. This stage can last for several weeks to a few months, depending on the growing conditions.

3. Stem Extension (Day 70-120): The wheat plant will continue to grow taller, with the stem elongating at a rapid pace. The plant will produce more tillers and leaves, and a nodal root system will form. This stage can last for several weeks to a few months.

4. Booting and Heading stage (Day 120-180 days): The wheat plant begins to form a head, or spike, at the top of the stem. The head will be enclosed in a protective sheath, called a boot, by the end of this phase head will emerge from the protective sheath. These phases can last for several weeks to a few months.

5. Flowering and Grain Fill (Day 180-260): The wheat plant will enter its reproductive stage, with flowers appearing on the spikes. Pollination will occur, and the flowers will develop into kernels of wheat. These kernels will fill with starch and protein, resulting in a mature grain. These phases last few months.

6. Ripening and Harvesting (Day 260-330): The wheat grains continue to ripen until they reach maturity. The wheat crop is ready for harvest when the grain is fully mature and the plant has turned golden brown in color. These phases can last from several weeks to months

## Factors that influence the Winter Wheat Growth Cycle
During the early stages of growth, wheat seeds need adequate temperature and humidity to germinate. Wheat seeds enjoy an optimal temperature between 15°C and 20°C. Under favorable conditions, the seedlings emerge within ten days. Until the first ear emerges, the seedling depends on the energy and nutrients stored in the seed.
As the growth cycle progresses, the pollination process begins. Pollination is normally very rapid and lasts only three to five days. The wheat is self-pollinated and the number of pollinated flowers will determine the amount of wheat grain that will be produced by the plant. High temperatures and drought stress during flowering can reduce the number of grains.
After pollination, the ripening phase begins. During this period, the wheat plant takes on a straw color and the grain becomes very hard. Harvesting can begin when the grain has reached an appropriate moisture level (between 14% and 20%; above this value, the grain is more likely to be damaged and storage problems occur).
