# Winter Wheat Growth Cycle

The winter wheat growth cycle is characterized by several phases, each of which is influenced
by certain factors such as the percentage of soil's nutrients, weather conditions or the quantity of fertilizer used.
It is interesting to observe and analyze how a wheat plantation grows under different conditions, from the best to the worst, and which factors influence it the most.

## Stages of Wheat Growth Cycle
The winter wheat growth cycle lasts between 270 to 330 days, depending on factors mentioned above.
Here's a general timeline of the growth stages:

1. Germination (Day 0-10): After planting, the seed will absorb soil's nutrients and begin to swell. The seed coat will then crack open, and a small root will emerge from one end, followed by a small plant that rises above the soil.

2. Tillering (Day 10-70): The wheat plant will continue to grow leaves and stems, forming a root system that reaches deeper into the soil. The plant will start to produce tillers, which are side shoots that grow from the main stem. At the end of this stage, the seeds that have not germinated will rot. This stage can last for several weeks to a few months, depending on the growing conditions.

3. Stem Extension (Day 70-120): The wheat plant will continue to grow taller, with the stem elongating at a rapid pace. The plant will produce more tillers and leaves, and a nodal root system will form. This stage can last for several weeks to a few months.

4. Booting and Heading stage (Day 120-180): The wheat plant begins to form spikes, at the top of the Tillers. The spike will be enclosed in a protective sheath, called a boot, by the end of this phase spike will emerge from the protective sheath. These phases can last for several weeks to a few months.

5. Flowering and Grain Fill (Day 180-260): The wheat plant will enter its reproductive stage, with Flowers appearing on the spikes. Pollination will occur, and the flowers will develop into kernels of wheat. These kernels will fill with starch and protein, resulting in a mature grain. These phases last few months.

6. Ripening and Harvesting (Day 260-330): The wheat Kernels continue to ripen until they reach maturity. The wheat crop is ready for harvest when the grain is fully mature and the plant has turned golden brown in color. These phases can last from several weeks to months

## Factors that influence the Winter Wheat Growth Cycle
During the early stages of growth, wheat seeds need adequate soil nutrients to germinate. Under favorable conditions, the plant start emerge within ten days. Until the first ear emerges, the seedling depends on the energy and nutrients stored in the seed.
The plant start developing tillers basing on environmental conditions such as daily waterreceived and temperature. Wheat seeds enjoy an optimal temperature between 10°C and 20°C and 4mm-6mm of water per day.
As the growth cycle progresses, the Tillers begin to produce Flowers, but it is important to know that not all shoots will flower, in fact at best only half of the Tillers will produce a flower.
Once the flowers appear the quantity of fertilizer applied to them and the soil's nutrients will determine how many Kernels there will be per flower, at best a flower produces from 20 to 50 kernels.
